# --- WorldMood Configuration File ---
# Welcome to WorldMood! This file allows you to customize how moods behave on your server.
# For numerical chances (like 0.1 for 10%), use decimals between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).
# Durations are generally in seconds, unless specified as minutes.

# === Global Settings ===
# These settings affect the entire plugin's operation.

# Master switch for the entire plugin. If false, no moods will occur.
# Expected: true or false
pluginEnabled: true

# Default duration for any mood if its specific 'duration' is not set below.
# Value is in seconds. Example: 300 = 5 minutes.
defaultMoodDuration: 300

# Enable the automatic random cycling of moods?
# If false, moods can only be started using the /worldmood start <mood_key> command.
# Expected: true or false
randomizeMoods: true

# If 'randomizeMoods' is true, this is how often (in minutes) the plugin
# will attempt to stop the current mood (if any) and start a new random one.
moodFrequencyMinutes: 30

# Should a message be broadcast server-wide when a mood starts or ends?
# Expected: true or false
broadcastMoodChanges: true

# Use a BossBar at the top of the screen to display the current mood name and remaining time?
# If false, players will rely on chat messages and the temporary scoreboard HUD (if enabled below).
# Expected: true or false
useBossBar: true

# Display a temporary Scoreboard HUD on the side of the screen when a mood starts,
# showing its name, description, and effects?
# Expected: true or false
useScoreboardHud: true

# How long (in seconds) should the temporary Scoreboard HUD stay visible after a mood starts?
# Set to 0 to disable the scoreboard even if useScoreboardHud is true.
hudDisplaySeconds: 15


# === Mood Specific Settings ===
# Each section below defines a unique world mood.
# - 'enabled': true or false - Whether this mood can be chosen by the random cycle or started by command.
# - 'weight':  A number (e.g., 1, 5, 10) - Higher numbers make the mood more likely to be chosen randomly
#              compared to other moods. Think of it as "tickets in a lottery."
# - 'duration': The length of this specific mood in seconds. This might be overridden by special
#               logic (e.g., CalmSkies lasting until day/night, VoidTension lasting 1 full day).
